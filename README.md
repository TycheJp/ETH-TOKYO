Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: "Decentralized Trust for Anonymous Workspaces"
Subtitle: "A peer-to-peer evaluation system for the DAO economy"

Slide 2: The Challenge
Title: "Establishing Trust in Anonymous Workspaces"
Bullets:

- Trust needed for work delegation within DAOs
- Current trust-building methods are limited
    - ① Verifying activities and ratings from other projects
    - ② Trusting self-reported achievements and outcomes
- Lack of objective and comprehensive trust assessment

Slide 3: The Solution
Title: "Distributed Member Evaluation System"
Bullets:

- Teammates can write encrypted evaluations for a user
- Evaluations are stored securely and privately
- Access evaluations using unique tokens sent to target user's wallet
- Incentivize evaluation disclosure with token rewards

Slide 4: The Vision
Title: "A World of Trustless Trust Exchange"
Bullets:

- Leverage reliable, third-party evaluations for trust-building
- Fair and unbiased decision-making for DAO and project collaborations
- Prevent false self-reporting and promote transparency
- Escape the "honest people suffer" scenario
